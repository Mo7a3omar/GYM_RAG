Storks,"This is a hip abductor eccentric strengthening exercise that only uses your body weight as resistance. Trust me when I say that this exercise looks much easier than it is (if you do it correctly!). To ensure you are doing good form pay attention to the rotation of your pelvis - make sure it stays squared forward during the entire movement (you should not be rotating the pelvis). Additionally, only lightly tap the wall with your hip, and do not lean your weight into the wall. Pretend the wall is made out of rice paper that will rip with the lightest amount of tension applied to it. This exercise gets more difficult the slower you do it. Aim for a controlled tempo of 4 seconds moving towards the wall, hold briefly and take 4 seconds to return to starting position.

Modified Horse Stance,This exercise has been adopted from Martial Arts as a strengthening and stability exercise for the lower body and low back. Wrap a band around the knees to increase gluteus muscle engagement and hold a squat position to resist your knees from buckling inwards (knocked knees). The goal of this exercise is to increase hip stability to prevent compensation patterns during a squat like the hip shift.

Isometric Pallof Squat,"This exercise’s goal is to strengthen your core stability while doing compounds movements like the squat. This exercise is also great for correcting a hip shift during a squat - a movement compensation that can stem from the lower kinetic chain or from weak core stability. To correct a hip shift place the band next to you on the opposite side of the direction you tend to shift towards. For general core stability training, do this exercise with the band alternating on each side (alternate with sets not repetitions).","Glutes, Quadriceps, Core, Deltoids","Functional Lumbar Instability, Non-Specific Low Back Pain, Sacroiliac Joint Syndrome, Thoracolumbar Syndrome, Squat Related Low Back Pain",N/A,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/isometric-pallof-squat

The box is there as both a safety net to catch you if you fall (helping to build confidence) and as an external cue to tell you that you have squatted deep enough. For this exercise it is important that the butt simply taps the box and does not sit on it completely as shown in the video. Keep the spine neutral and feet in any distance apart that feels comfortable and natural.

Reactive Lateral Catch,This is a late stage rotator cuff rehabilitation exercise that strengthens the shoulder and improves joint proprioception. The rotator cuff has been shown to increase in muscle activity with grip based activities. This exercise takes advantage of this mechanism by stressing the shoulder joint while repeatedly grip and relaxing the hand through a ball drop and catch movement.

Chinese Back Plank,"This exercise is the exact opposite of a conventional plank. If a regular plank strengthens the abdominal and core muscles along the front of your body, the Chinese Back Plank will strengthen the muscles of the lower back and posterior chain. To do this exercise properly, make sure the spine is neutral and the core is braced and hips are in neutral. A common mistake is using the low back to hyperextend instead of using the hip and glute muscles to extend the hip into a neutral position (compensation pattern).","Core, Erector Spinae, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves, Latissimus Dorsi","Non-specific Low Back Pain, Hamstrings Tendinopathy, Sacroiliac Joint Syndrome, Scoliosis, Anterior Pelvic Tilt, Lower Cross Syndrome, Hip Impingement, Glute Amnesia",N/A,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/chinese-back-plank

Bear Hug Flexion-Extension,This is a thoracic mobility exercise that aims to increase flexion and extension range of motion. The bear hug position is used to dissociate scapular motion away from the thoracic spine. This is important for those who tend to end up with shoulder pain as they use their shoulder to compensate for lack of thoracic spine mobility,"Trapezius, Erector Spinae, Multifidus","Upper Back Pain, Headaches, Rotator Cuff Tears, Shoulder Impingement, Frozen Shoulder",N/A,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/bear-hug-flexion-extension
Doorway Rib Lean,This is a thoracic spine mobility exercise that targets the costotransverse and costovertebral joints (rib joints with the spine) to help reduce back pain. Start by placing the forearm of the target’s arm on a wall at roughly shoulder height. Place your opposite hand on your shoulder and press downwards to stabilize the shoulder joint. Lean forwards and use the shoulder blade to push the rib joints forwards.
